              <p class="lead">After 27 years of imprisonment in South Africa, Nelson Mandela was unconditionally released. In 1962, he was sentenced to life in prison in the Rivonia trial after being convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the state. Mandela was the last African National Congress prisoner to be released. Mandela’s release marked the beginning of a new era for racially tense South Africa and led to the unbanning of the African National Congress. </p>

              <p class="lead">While the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 may have set things in motion, 1990 was all but the end of the USSR. On January 1st, Ukrainian was reinstated as the official language of the Ukraine Bigger changes of the Soviet Union were on the horizon and not just the country’s first McDonald's. On March 9th, Georgia declared sovereignty, followed by Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Russia itself declared sovereignty on June 11th and later elected Boris Yeltsin as President.

              <p class="lead">Margaret Thatcher, the first woman prime minister in British history, announces her resignation after 11 years in Britain’s top office. During her tenure as prime minister, the longest since the late 19th century, Mrs. Thatcher was dubbed the Iron Lady—a title she relished—by Moscow for her outspoken opposition to the Soviet Union. But her economic policies considered tough on unions and Britain’s welfare state, and, together with her lack of support for the Common Market, proved her undoing within her own party. She was and remains a profoundly divisive figure in British politics.</p>
