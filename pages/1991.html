              <h2 class="display-4">Persian Gulf War</h2>
              <p class="lead">Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait set off a brief but consequential conflict involving an international coalition of forces led by the United States to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. The Persian Gulf War began with a massive US-led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm. An armistice was signed after 42 days of relentless attacks by the allied coalition, ending the Persian Gulf War. Though the Persian Gulf War was initially considered an unqualified success for the international coalition, simmering conflict in the troubled region led to a second Gulf War–known as the Iraq War–that began in 2003. </p>

              <p class="lead">Irish Republican Army (IRA) mortar bombs are fired at 10 Downing Street, London, the official residence of the British prime minister. It was an attempt to assassinate Prime Minister John Major and his War Cabinet, who were meeting to discuss the Gulf War. One of the heavy mortar shells exploded in the back garden of Number 10, only yards from the cabinet office. Due to the bomb-proof windows, none of the cabinet were hurt, though four other people received minor injuries, including two police officers. The other two shells overshot Downing Street and landed on a green nearby. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">The Legacy of Freddie Mercury</h2>
              <p class="lead">Freddie Mercury was only 45 when he died of AIDS on November 24, 1991. As the first major rock star to die of AIDS, Mercury's death brought the tragedy of AIDS home to millions of fans worldwide and represented an important event in the history of the disease. Following the death of the British rock group Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury, the single ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ is re-released and goes to number one in the UK charts for the second time. One American critic noted, “What cynics call the ‘dead star’ factor had come into play – Queen is in the middle of a major resurgence.” </p>
