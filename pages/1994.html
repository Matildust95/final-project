              <h2 class="display-4">Nelson Mandela Elected President</h2>
              <p class="lead">“Never, never again will this beautiful land experience the oppression of one by another.” Those were the words of Nelson Mandela on May 10, 1994, as he made history by be-coming the first black president in South Africa. His journey to the post had been arduous, having spent 27 years in jail as a political prisoner of the South African Government. The campaigner, who became an international icon for human rights, fought against apartheid and for freedom of his peo-ple. He was a well-educated man, having become a lawyer after attending university, something which no doubt helped him later when he fought against the poor treatment of black people in South Africa. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Grunge Rock Icon Kurt Cobain</h2>
              <p class="lead">On April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain died of an apparent suicide. The singer and guitarist of the mega-rock band Nirvana was just 27 years old. Cobain’s music is his greatest legacy, but he also became an unlikely fashion icon. His scruffy look helped launch the “grunge” fashion trend of the early 90s. It was both loved and reviled. Part of the lasting appeal of grunge fashion is that Nirvana’s music is still popular. If you put on “Smells Like Teen Spirit” it feels no less fresh and relevant than it did in 1991. The Nirvana man's death was '94 pop culture's darkest moment. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Pulp Fiction</h2>
              <p class="lead">In 1994, a film was released that would make an impact on all who saw it. Pulp Fiction, the second film from Quentin Tarantino, was a slick dive into an underground world of hitmen, drug dealers, crooked boxers and love-struck diner robbers. Told in non-linear chapters, it was a stark and refreshing take on cinema during a decade which saw Hollywood in a state of flux. Teetering on the edge of a digital future, the film was a reminder of the techniques that had gotten us this far. A quarter of a century on, it’s still considered one of the finest movies ever made. </p>
