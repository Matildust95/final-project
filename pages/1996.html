              <p class="lead">Pokémon, originally called Capsule Monsters and Pocket Monsters, is one of the world’s most beloved and far-reaching franchises in the history of beloved and far-reaching franchises. It all began when a man from Game Freak, Satoshi Tajiri, had an idea based on his hobby when he was younger, bug collecting. From the long period of pre-release, Pokémon Red & Green were finally released in 1996 in Japan. With undeniable staying (and playing) power since its creation, it has since become the second-most successful and lucrative video game-based media franchises in the world, behind only Nintendo's own Mario empire. </p>

              <p class="lead">Born at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell taken from a mammary gland of another sheep. She had six little lambs during her six-and-a-half-year life, dying in 2003. Even though Dolly was not the first animal cloned, she received media attention because she was the first cloned from an adult cell. After cloning was successfully demonstrated through the production of Dolly, many other large mammals were cloned, including pigs, deer, horses and bulls. Scientific American concluded in 2016 that the main legacy of Dolly the sheep has not been cloning of animals but in advances into stem cell research.</p>

              <p class="lead">In a major technological development, the chess computer, “Deep Blue,” defeated world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. The computer was Deep Blue, a machine designed by IBM capable of computing 100 million positions per second. It was the first time that a chess-playing computer defeated a reigning world champion under normal chess tournament conditions. This computer developed by IBM pushed the bounds of technology and prompted the world to think about the budding relationship between humans and technology.</p>
