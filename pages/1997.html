              <p class="lead">While there were many noteworthy events this year, 1997 will no doubt always be remembered, in part, due to two major deaths that shook the world. This was the year that Diana, Princess of Wales, died tragically in an automobile crash. Diana had captured the imagination of the world with her beauty, grace, and her prolific charity work. Another passing also shook the world. This was the year that Mother Teresa of Calcutta died after struggling with heart problems for many years. Mother Teresa was known around the world for her piety and especially for her charity work in some of the most impoverished corners of the world. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Hong Kong’s Return to China</h2>
              <p class="lead">In 1839, Britain invaded China to crush opposition to its interference in the country’s economic, social, and political affairs. One of Britain’s first acts of the war was to occupy Hong Kong, a sparsely inhabited island off the coast of southeast China. In 1984, after years of negotiations, the British and the Chinese signed a formal agreement approving the 1997 turnover of the island in exchange for a Chinese pledge to preserve Hong Kong’s capitalist system. Hong Kong was peaceably handed over to China in a ceremony attended by numerous Chinese, British, and international dignitaries. The chief executive under the new Hong Kong government, Tung Chee Hwa, formulated a policy based on the concept of “one country, two systems,” thus preserving Hong Kong’s role as a principal capitalist center in Asia.</p>

              <p class="lead">Twenty years after their mass suicide made headlines across the world, Heaven’s Gate is still one of the most notorious cults of the 20th century – not to mention one of the most recognizable. In 1997, 39 members ate apple sauce laced with barbiturates and washed it down with vodka. They weren’t killing themselves, they thought, but freeing their souls from their so they could ascend to a spacecraft flying in the wake of the Hale-Bopp comet – which at that point was passing by Earth – and were going to be taken to their new home in space. Instead, police found their bodies on March 26th, and the images from the scene would be burned into the eyes of a generation.</p>
