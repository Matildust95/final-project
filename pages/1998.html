              <p class="lead">The Clinton–Lewinsky scandal was a United States political sex scandal that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Drudge Report broke news of Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky in 1998 and the scandal lasted throughout the year, eventually resulting in the House of Representatives bringing forward articles of impeachment for Clinton to the Senate in December. Clinton ended a televised speech with the statement that he "did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky." The wide reporting of the scandal led to criticism of the press for over-coverage. Monika Lewinsky has since said that it was the  support of her family, their empathy and compassion that cushioned her best from the judgment of the world.  </p>

              <p class="lead">In 1998, a pair of Ph.D. students from Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, created our beloved Google search engine. Google originally started as a research project whose aim was to find relevant search results using a mathematical algorithm. The algorithm, later called PageRank, analyzed relationships between individual webpages based on their cross-references, thus assessing their importance. The name Google is a misspelling of Googol, chosen to suggest very large numbers. Google has become the most used web-based search engine.</p>

              <p class="lead">For those who missed Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo and Juliet some months earlier, this was the cinematic moment that made Leonardo DiCaprio (who played Jack) a bonafide Hollywood heartthrob. Directed by James Cameron and co-starring Kate Winslet (who took on the role of Rose), it was the release of the year and went on to be nominated for 14 Academy Awards. It also made Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', the film's main theme song, the second best-selling single by a female artist in history. </p>
