              <p class="lead">The Y2K Scare, or the “Millennium Bug”, was a major perceived threat of the late 1990s. Anxiety spread across the world as people feared that the computer systems would shut down on December 31, 1999. As a result, stock prices of banking institutions dropped in value and there were rumours that planes would drop from the sky when the clocks turned to midnight. Billions of dollars were spent world-wide on Y2K upgrade on computer software to avert the risk. At 4:00 AM on December 31, 1999 as the new year passes on the little island of Fiji, they discover that the supposed Y2K Bug will not cause impending doom. Computer programs updated to the new dates and carried on as usual. "Millennium Bug" as millions of dollars were spent in preparation of the Y2K problem. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">The Matrix</h2>
              <p class="lead">In 1999, The Matrix was released, and everyone swallowed the red pill and went down the rabbit hole with Neo and Morpheus. For a movie that will soon mark its 20th anniversary, The Matrix has aged remarkably well. In part because it was so far ahead of its time to begin with, but also because it’s had a profound influence on moviemaking ever since. The Matrix popularized the special effect phenomenon dubbed “bullet time”, impressed with its carefully choreographed fight scenes, and it singlehandedly helped propel the adoption of the new video format, DVDs. When the movie came out on home video, it became the first to sell 1 million copies on DVD.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">The Kosovo War Ended</h2>
              <p class="lead">The Kosovo War was an armed conflict in Kosovo that started in late February 1998 and lasted until 11 June 1999. It was fought by Serbia and Montenegro, which controlled Kosovo before the war, and the Kosovo Liberation Army. After attempts at a diplomatic solution failed, NATO intervened, justifying the campaign in Kosovo as a “humanitarian war”. The war ended with the Kumanovo Treaty, with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo. The NATO bombing campaign has remained controversial, as it did not gain approval of the UN Security Council and because it caused at least 488 Yugoslav civilian deaths, including substantial numbers of Kosovar refugees. After the war, a list was compiled which documented that over 13,500 people were killed or went missing during the two-year conflict.</p>
