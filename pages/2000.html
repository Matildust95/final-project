              <h2 class="display-4">Bush Versus Gore</h2>
              <p class="lead">In the November 2000 presidential election between Republican candidate George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, the race in Florida was such a close call that it instigated an automatic machine count of votes under the state’s law. It showed that less than 600 votes separated the candidates, prompting Gore to request a manual recount in four counties. Because it was deemed impossible to complete the manual recount in the amount of days required by law (hanging chads, anyone?), a legal battle ensued between Gore and the state of Florida. It went all the way to the Supreme Court, where it was ruled that the methods in the recount violated the 14th amendment, concluding the endeavour and clearing the way for George W. Bush to become the 43rd president of the United States. </p>

              <p class="lead">As the millennium approached, Earth Day’s founder John McConnell wanted to spearhead a campaign focused on global warming and a push for clean energy. With 5,000 environmental groups in a record 184 countries reaching out to hundreds of millions of people, Earth Day 2000 built both global and local conversations, leveraging the power of the Internet to organize activists around the world, while also featuring a drum chain that travelled from village to village in Gabon, Africa. Hundreds of thousands of people also gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC for a First Amendment Rally. 30 years on, Earth Day 2000 sent world leaders a loud and clear message: Citizens around the world wanted quick and decisive action on global warming and clean energy.</p>

              <p class="lead">The Enschede fireworks disaster was a catastrophic fireworks explosion occurring at the SE Fireworks depot in the eastern Dutch city of Enschede. The fire led to an enormous explosion which killed 23 people including four firefighters and injured 947. Four hundred homes were destroyed and 1,500 buildings damaged. The first explosion had a strength in the order of 800 kg TNT equivalence, while the strength of the final explosion was within the range of 4000–5000 kg TNT. The biggest blast was felt up to 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the scene. Dutch Television interrupted transmission of the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 midway through the programme, to show breaking news coverage. Dutch telephone voting in the Contest was also suspended to free up capacity for the emergency services communications.</p>
